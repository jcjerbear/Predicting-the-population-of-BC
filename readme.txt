figure-wise:
1) should make the red line into points instead of curve
2) add legends
3) choose 1995

report argument wise:
1) carrying capacity
2) reason why we choose 1995 can be that the data points before 1995 seems to grow 
a bit exponentially with a steeper slope, so it doesnt seem to fit with the current
population circumstance. So we choose the initial year to be 1995 where the population
has a structural change where it levels off and starts gradually growing linearly 
so then we start approximating from there
3) the approximation curve of the 1995 one seems to fit with the last couple data points
of the 1995 one the best
4) the second term of the logistic formula is based on limited resourses approximation
5) trying to cut down the leveling off effect from the 1986 one because BC's resources are 
sure still capable of having more population growing because BC has not reached its
carrying capacity yet. So it should not have a leveling off effect showing on the figure
so dont choose those one
6) 


based on the logistic formula, i believe that the 1995 one is the best among all strictly becuz...
take an effort to minimize the nonrealistic effect.
